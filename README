README

Contained herein are sources showing how to utililze Digital Gov Search API.

https://search.usa.gov

Why use this API? Because you can show custom search listing inside your site making it appear as if you have a full search feature on your site. Digital Gov Search provides search analytics to help you re-tune your content for your users.

You will need to create a valid account before you can use your own affiliate account. Included is a .JSON data source for testing your implementation.

The example uses JQuery and javascript to retrieve the JSON search API output.


File List:
README; your here.
digitalGovAPI.html; html file containing the main script body with three functions. GET the json data, display the json data, and create a page index for the json search listings.
test_data.json; for testing your script so as to not ping the live search API until your ready. Highlighting is turned off.
